    <h2>Origami</h2>
    <p>Origami is one of my hobbies. I did it a lot when I was elementary cause it was a simple lazy gift to give to classmates on their birthday. As long as I didn't always make the same origami piece for every classmate it was a cute little gift. As of now I do origami to occupy my hands or pass the time so I've forgotten many of the models I used to remember as a child. Two models I remember very clearly are <span style="font-weight:bold">Jo Nakashima's</span> model of the Origami Dragon, as well as a modular origami ball. I memorized the dragon a long time ago because I liked dragons and it looks cool. I like the modular ball because it uses 30 pieces so I can just shut off my brain and repeatedly make the same pieces 30 times. Both the dragon and the ball I've made many many many times, enough that I can definitely teach someone how to make either of them.</p>
    <h2>Dragon</h2>

        <h4 class="imgdesc"> A dragon I made a few minutes ago </h4>
    </div>
    <h3 style="color:brown">Jo Nakashima</h3>
    <p>I watched a lot of Jo Nakashima's origami videos because they're easier to follow. He does it relatively slow and the image at the top right of the screen helps a lot.</p>
    <p>A few of my favorite videos include</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Origami Eagle</li>
        <li>Dollar Bill Hare</li>
        <li>Plush Origami Tsuru</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Ball</h2>
    <p> There's actually 3 different "shapes" you can make with the pieces. With 6 of them, you can make a cube, and with 12 of them you can make a different smaller looking ball. I like making the 30 piece one because it looks rounder and it's more time consuming. During my Sophomore year where we were all remote, I made a lot of the modular balls beacuse with my camera off, no one could see me with 20 pieces sprawled out on my table.</p>
