    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p>My hobbies include <span style="font-weight:bold">origami</span> and <span style="font-weight:bold">drawing</span>. I like origami because it keeps my occupied for a long time whether I'm making typical origami with a single sheet of paper or modular origami with many pieces. I like to draw but if someone told me to try to draw something my skills will revert to that of a 10 year old. I also know how to knit but I've never knitted anying particularly impressive. I've only knitted scarves. I might pick it back up again to learn more stitches. I also like to bike but I haven't biked in a while since I've lost my bike.</p>
    <h2>Interests</h2>
    <p>I like a lot of anime, manga, and webnovels. <span style="font-weight:bold">Madoka Magica</span> is one of my favorite animes. <span style="font-weight:bold">One Piece</span> is my favorite manga. And <span style="font-weight:bold">Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint</span> is my favorite webnovel. I also like games but I have a Mac so I can't play pc games. I'm stuck with mobile games. I'm currently playing Epic Seven, Project SEKAI, and Survivor.io. I have other games I'd like to redownload like Apex and Identity V but Genshin takes up too much space and I don't have the heart to delete it yet. I mostly listen to J-pop and Electronic music.</p>
    <p>My favorite artists include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Camellia</li>
        <li>Sub Urban</li>
        <li>Giga</li>
        <li>Kenshi Yonezu</li>
    </ul>
