    <h2>My Spots</h2>
    <p>My dad has always been a big foodie so he took me to a lot of different places to eat. He'd either take me to eat a new kind of cuisine or he'd take me to try restaurants in the neighborhood so I can get a feel of the food from the restaurants around me. While most spots for good food are from my dad taking me around, my mom is the one for the tourist locations. She would be the one to take me whenever she'd find see new things whether it be the mini golf course by one of the piers and Little Island a bit further down the river or just a walk to browse the christmas windows at Macys. </p>
    <h2>Places To Eat</h2>
    <p>I frequent Chinatown a lot. so these are a few places I enjoy eating in.</p>

    <h2>Places To Go</h2>
    <p>Again, my mom was usually the one who took me places. She took me to The Vessel early on before they stopped letting people climb it. The Vessel is closed from letting people climb it because people have jumped off of it before. We went when it had just opened so you had to get tickets since they couldn't let in so many people at a time. The wait time was around 3 hours and there was a mall nearby so we wandered around in there. We spent so much time walking around that by the time we were at the bottom of the Vessel about to climb the stairs up, we were already tired of walking. I had some photos we took there but I can't find them.</p>
